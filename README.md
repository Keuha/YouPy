# YouPy
a youtube video/audio/playlist downloader made in python 3 using Pafy

Still in progress

To use it:

./YouPy [-option]

Option:

--url : paste a youtube URL here
--video : if you want to download the video clip
--playlist : if you want to dowload a whole playlist
--artist : inform artist name (won't work with --playlist)
--song : informe song name (won't work with --playlist)
--convert : convert audio track in MP3 (use ffmpeg)


YouPy will create a repository named after the artist name and put the song downloaded in it.
All files will be downloaded on maximum available YouTube quality
While downloading a playlist, repository will be named after playlist name.

I know that a lot of software already do it, but i wanted to do one by myself.

Feel free to fork me !
